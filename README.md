# bi11y
An 11ty starter for people who like this exact 11ty starter.

There are many, _many_ 11ty starters. A lot of them are great! Some of them aren't. Good or bad, they tend to be feature heavy. Bi11y's goal is simple and its features are light - be a clean, reusable, 11ty starter that implements PostCSS and a modern bundling solution (esbuild) the _11ty way_. And that's it...
